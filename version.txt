Release notes 
=============
Version 3.5 (14-OCT-2018): implements a main function that uses the 
maxent code.

Version 3.4 (March 2012): from now on each node carries its own prior
function independently of whether the mesh uses "unstructured" capability
or not. This will allow to eventually define different prior functions 
among the nodes. As a consequence, one needs in any case to supply a 
vector of size number of nodes containing gamma for each node. 
This change affected prior.m function and inputdata.m function.

Version 3.3 (January 2012): Fixed a bug in the "unstructured" capability.
This affected the computation of the basis function support radius in 
prior.m file and also inputdata.m function. For "unstructured" one needs 
to supply a vector of size number of nodes containing gamma for each 
node. If "unstructured" is not used only a scalar can be supplied as gamma.

Version 3.2 (September 2010): Added capability for unstructured generated
nodes. When an unstructured set of nodes is available, "unstructured"
variable in inputdata.m file should be set to 1. This way, the support radius
of basis functions is computed for each node independently.

Version 3.1 (February 2010): Fixed minor errors in printing options. Improved
function nodespacing.m

Version 3/Release 2009.4 (August 2009): Change the way to find the
neighbors. Add new function neighbors.m and update prior.m accordingly.

Version 3/Release 2009.3 (August 2009): Correct a bug in
phidermatrices.m. Add maxent iteration tolerance parameter "rtol" in
inputdata.m

Version 3/Release 2009.2 (April 2009): Constant prior added in order to
obtain standard Shanoon/Jaynes entropy. In file: prior.m

Version 3/Release 2009.1 (February 2009): Added option to specify whether 
basis functions derivatives must be computed. Function getallmaxentdata.m
changed by inputdata.m. Computes maxent for any prior and its corresponding
gradient.

Version 3/Release 2008.4 (May 2008)(THIS VERSION SUPERSEDES PAST VERSION 
OF MAXENT in 1D): Computes MAXENT basis functions in 1d, 2D and 3D as detailed 
in Reference [2] and its derivatives as detailed in Reference [3].

Version 2/Release 2008.3 (May 2008): Shape functions derivatives added as
detailed in Reference [3].
 
Version 2/Release 2008.2 (April 2008): Prior function added as detailed 
in Reference [2]. When specifying prior function a Gaussian (RBF) weight 
function is considered.

Version 1/Release 2008.1 (March 2008): Compute MAXENT shape functions 
using standard Shannon-Jaynes principle as detailed in Reference [1].
