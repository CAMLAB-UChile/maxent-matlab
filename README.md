# Instructions
The program is controlled by the main.m function. This is the only function that 
must be setup by the user. To execute the code, setup the problem parameters in
main.m (further instructions are given there) and run it.

When setting up main.m make sure that
  - size(x,2) = dim
  - length(x) = size(ncoord,2)
  - size(ncoord,1) = n
  - length(gamma) = n
  - length(ilambda) = dim
  
Anyway, an error is thrown when any of the previous equalities are not satisfied.
